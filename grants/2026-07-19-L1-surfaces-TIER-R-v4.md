# GRANT · Level 1 · the eight surfaces — **TIER R (reproducible)**

**Supersedes** [`2026-07-19-L1-surfaces-TIER-R-v3.md`](2026-07-19-L1-surfaces-TIER-R-v3.md).
Issued to add a scope limitation, not to add strength — see the next section. Superseded
rather than amended because §5.1a says grants are never amended, and carving an exception
for "this edit only weakens it" is how the rule stops meaning anything. The judgement of
whether an edit adds strength cannot be left to the party making it.

**Supersedes** [`2026-07-18-L1-surfaces-TIER-R-v2.md`](2026-07-18-L1-surfaces-TIER-R-v2.md).
Issued because v2 was **amended after publication** — the line-ending durability section was
appended to it rather than issued as a new record. Ladder §5.1a says grants are superseded,
never amended, and the reason is exactly this: an appended verification makes a grant
stronger than the one that was issued. "Verified under three git configurations" is a
stronger claim than "verified once", and it arrived by edit rather than by issuance.

The durability check itself stands and is included below. What was wrong was the mechanism,
not the finding. v2 is left **with its append visible** rather than reverted — scrubbing the
error would hide the thing this supersession exists to record.

**Supersedes** [`2026-07-18-L1-surfaces-TIER-R.md`](2026-07-18-L1-surfaces-TIER-R.md),
which superseded the provisional grant. Superseding, never amending — ladder §5.1a. Both
earlier records stay in place beneath their banners, because **the history is the argument**.

**Two supersessions in one day is not embarrassing — it is the record working.** The first
grant was honest about its weight and obsolete by evening; the second was obsolete by the
next order; both are still readable.

## The grant

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Level** | **L1** |
| **Tier** | **R — reproducible** (ladder §5.1b) |
| Axis A · Artifact | 1 |
| Axis D · Delivery | 1 |
| Axis O · Operations | 0 — no requirement at L1 |
| Graded commit | `9d271e8be3e69ed5fa500159f694f9a197299614` |
| Verifier | `verify/verify-l1.sh` at the same commit — the tool is pinned as tightly as the artifacts |
| Date | 2026-07-18 |
| Granting party | **any reader.** That is the point. |

## The expected output, verbatim

Run the command above and you should see exactly this. Diff it character for character.

```
artifacts_enumerated=8
A1a_external_references=0 (over 8 files)
A1b_fetched=8 served_matches_recorded=8
D1_disclosure_in_artifacts=8/8
RESULT=PASS
```

Exit code `0`. **Exit `2` is a refusal, not a pass** — no verdict could be formed.

## What changed since the superseded grant

**D1 is now satisfied in each artifact, not at directory level.** All eight footers carry a
byte-identical disclosure:

> Served by one operator who can log every reader and withdraw this page at will. Not
> censorship-resistant, not unobserved.

A reader arriving by direct link — the normal case — now receives the disclosure. Previously
they received none, because it lived only in a directory README they never saw. D1 was **not**
amended to accept the weaker reading; the artifacts were changed to meet the ratified rule.

The output line reads `D1_disclosure_in_artifacts=8/8`. The old `directory-level` label is
gone — a label describing the superseded reading would be a stale claim.

## The graded digests

A byte change voids this grant for the changed file. That is why the digests are here.

## The verifier was watched biting (Law 2)

`sh verify/verify-l1.sh selftest` runs **14 fixtures on every CI build**. Run it yourself.

The three added for this grant test D1 per-artifact, and the first is the one that carries
the argument — the disclosure removed from a **single** artifact while the README stays
intact:

```
OLD check (directory-level)  ->  D1 PASS   <- would have shipped
NEW check (per-artifact)     ->  D1 FAIL   <- bites
```

Same bytes, opposite verdicts. A refined check nobody watched change behaviour is a
refactor wearing a fix's clothes.

| Fixture | Expected |
|---|---|
| intact copy | pass |
| `<script src>`, `<link href>`, `@import`, `url()`, `fetch()`, protocol-relative `//` | fail (six fixtures) |
| inert URL in text | **pass** — text is not a reference |
| one byte flipped, size and refs unchanged | fail (digest alone) |
| **disclosure removed from one artifact, README intact** | **fail** |
| disclosure **altered** in one artifact | fail — identical wording is the property |
| disclosure in README only, absent from all eight | fail |
| **empty file set** | **refuse, exit 2** |
| wrong-origin serve | fail |

## What this does not buy — carried forward unsoftened

**A reproducible L1 is a strong L1. It is not a higher level.** The three standing
limitations do not disappear because the tier went up or because D1 got stricter; a stronger
grant that quietly drops the weaker one's caveats is a worse grant.

1. **Digest provenance is trust-on-first-use.** This verifies local == recorded == served.
   It does **not** establish the digests were recorded *before* publication rather than
   back-filled. That rests on the git history, which the verifier does not audit.
2. **Serving is point-in-time.** The bytes matched when you ran it. The disclosure now
   printed on every page concedes the operator can withdraw them at will.
3. **No egress-blocked render was observed.** Zero external references implies it by
   construction — there is nothing to fetch — but nobody watched a browser do it.

These surfaces are **not** content-addressed, **not** retrievable from independent gateways,
and **not** censorship-resistant. Those are L2 and L3 properties and this tree does not hold
them. One operator serves these and can withdraw them — which is now stated on every page
rather than in a README most readers never open.

## Clearance status, stated plainly

**All eight founder clearances are void** as of this byte pass — the second reset in one
day. A grant is not a clearance: this record certifies that the served bytes match what was
recorded and carry no fetchable external references and carry the disclosure. It does **not**
certify that a human has read them for category. That eyeball is owed.

---

**Audited, not proven.** The strongest claim here is *sound by construction*, for item 3
only. A1 and D1 are met on evidence any reader can regenerate.

---

## Line-ending durability — checked after the fact, and it holds

An R-tier grant promises *"clone it and run the command yourself."* That promise is only
worth what it survives on **someone else's machine**, and a clean-clone check run under the
author's own git configuration establishes that it works *there* — not that it works.

Git's `core.autocrlf` rewrites line endings on checkout. Where it applies, a digest-pinned
artifact hashes differently for the reader than for the author, and **the reader's honest
conclusion is that the file was tampered with.** A digest that fails on clone is worse than
no digest at all.

This was checked properly rather than assumed. `.gitattributes` in this repository carries
`* text=auto eol=lf`, which forces LF on checkout regardless of the reader's setting, and
the surfaces were re-cloned under **every** relevant configuration:

| clone config | digests matching |
|---|---|
| `core.autocrlf=true` (Windows default) | **8/8** |
| `core.autocrlf=input` | **8/8** |
| `core.autocrlf=false` | **8/8** |

The verifier was then run end-to-end from a clone made under `core.autocrlf=true` — the
hostile case — and reproduced L1 in full.

**Why this is recorded rather than merely done:** the sibling repository
`beehive-biomass/bNATURE.bio` pinned a fixture digest *without* this protection and the
digest did not survive a clone. It was caught, fixed with `fixtures/** -text`, and
re-verified by re-cloning rather than by re-hashing a working copy. The same exposure would
have made this grant nominal in exactly the case it exists to serve. It does not, and now
there is a record saying so with the configurations named.

---

## This grant is not an accessibility audit

It certifies three things: served bytes hash to the recorded digests, the artifacts carry no
fetchable external reference, and the delivery disclosure is present in each. **It says
nothing about whether a person can read the page.**

That distinction is not hypothetical here. `d12_fat_scan_result.html` uses `--info` for its
spread-chip text at **3.95:1**, below the WCAG 2.1 AA minimum of 4.5:1 — while holding this
grant, passing every check in `verify-l1.sh`, and reproducing byte-for-byte from any clone.
**Granted, verified, reproducible, and failing AA at the same time.**

A reader who sees `RESULT=PASS` beside a page they cannot read would be right to feel
misled, and the fix is for the grant to say what it covers before an audit says what it
doesn't.

**A grant is not a clearance** — it does not certify that a human read the surface for
category. **A grant is not an accessibility audit** — it does not certify that a human can
read the surface at all. Both are stated here rather than inferred from silence, because a
green result is read as broader than it is by exactly the people least equipped to check.

The accessibility audit of these eight is order C-5 and is **not complete**. One finding is
already recorded above and was surfaced by a checker, not by inspection.

## What was verified about durability, and how

`.gitattributes` carries `* text=auto eol=lf`. The surfaces re-clone with matching digests
under `core.autocrlf` true, input and false — 8/8 in every case — and the verifier was run
end to end from a clone made under `autocrlf=true`, the hostile case. The R promise holds on
a stranger's machine, not merely on the author's.
